# e-puck_mplabx_master
Master MPLAB-X files for Gctronic demo epuck software
This branch modifies the main.cc and asercom.c to provide a serial connection from the 
Raspberry Pi zero rather than the default Bluetooth.
All of the selector functions and the related application c files have been removed also.
